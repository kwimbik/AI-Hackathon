# 🍼 ママとパパどっちが好きなの？  
**The Battle for Baby's First Words**

## 🎮 Overview

"ママ" or "パパ"... or maybe... "バカ"!?

**最初言葉バトル！** is a fast, fun, anime-style 1-minute showdown where two parents — one human and one AI — compete to influence their baby's very first word.

But there's a twist: a third character joins the fight — a dog! The AI dog doesn’t speak human words, it just barks ("ワンワン") randomly, adding chaos to the scene 🐶.

## 🕹 How It Works

- Player chooses to be **ママ** or **パパ**.
- The player types their character's dialogue freely (in Japanese).
- The AI parent generates funny or emotional responses — sometimes related, sometimes totally off-topic.
- The AI **dog** just barks or makes “dog sounds” randomly during the game.
- You have **1 minute** to win over the baby through words.
- At the end, the baby says their **first word**, with a fun animation:
  - Laughing if it’s a silly or "bad" word
  - Emotional reactions depending on the outcome

Will the baby say “ママ”? “パパ”? Or something completely unexpected like “マンマ” or “バ
カ”!?

## 🖼 Scene Details

- 👶 The baby lies in a cozy bed in the center of the screen.
- 🧑‍🍼 The player and AI parent stand on each side of the bed, facing each other.
- 🐶 The AI dog stands at the foot of the bed, occasionally barking.
- 🌇 A window is behind the baby — it's part of the background scenery.
- Later mode models will be used for specific actions like turning to a dog or reacting to 変なおじさん

## Prepared Sounds
- Baby’s crying sound is “crying.mp3”
- Baby’s laughing sound is “laughing.mp3”

⏳ **Surprise twist!**  
Just before the 1-minute time limit ends, **変なおじさん (Weird Uncle)** appears suddenly in the window. He delivers a funny or cryptic line that fits his chaotic vibe — disrupting the tension for a final laugh before the baby speaks.

## 🎚 Difficulty Levels

There are two difficulty modes:

- 🍼 **よちよちモード** – Easy Mode (Toddle Mode): More predictable and friendly AI responses  
- Player always chooses from 3 possible sentences given to him
- 🔥 **ガチ育児モード** – Hard Mode (Hardcore Parenting): More aggressive, chaotic, and sarcastic AI behavior
- Player types everything on his own

Choose wisely — parenting is not for the weak!

## 🌐 Game Language

**The game is entirely in Japanese.**  
Players must enter dialogue in Japanese, and all AI responses and UI are also in Japanese.
